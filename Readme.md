Meal Search App
This is a JavaScript app that allows users to search for meals using the MealDB API. Users can enter a meal name and the app will display the details of that meal, including its name, area of origin, ingredients, and instructions on how to prepare it.

The app is built using vanilla JavaScript and fetch API to make HTTP requests to the MealDB API. It uses event listeners to handle user input and display the results.

How to use the app
To use the app, simply enter a meal name into the search bar and click the "Search" button. If the user input is valid, the app will display the details of the first matching meal, including its name, area of origin, ingredients, and instructions.

Users can view the recipe details by clicking the "View Recipe" button. The app will display a list of ingredients and instructions on how to prepare the meal. Users can close the recipe details by clicking the "x" button.

If the user input is invalid or the app encounters an error while making a request to the API, an error message will be displayed.
